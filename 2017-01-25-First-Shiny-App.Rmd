Today I published my first Shiny app. It's an unfinished but working app that queries PubMed given a list of search terms, and returns the results in a way that someone can quickly scroll through and read over the abstracts. 

It's available [here](https://mbontrager.shinyapps.io/pubmed_search/)

Pretty cool!
